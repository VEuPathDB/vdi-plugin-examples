= VDI Handler Plugin Script Examples

This repository contains example implementations of the VDI Plugin Handler
Server's plugin API in various languages.

Each directory under the  root directory is intended to be a jumping off point
for the development of a VDI plugin.  All that is necessary is to copy the
contents of the target directory (or directories) into a new repository.

== Usage

=== Demonstration

Each one of the examples contains a working Dockerfile that can be used to spin
up a working VDI Plugin Handler Server instance.

For convenience, the steps necessary to build and start a working example
container have been provided in the included `makefile`.

TODO

* copy `example.env` to just `.env`
* edit the credentials
* spin up sshuttle or some other method to give you access to the LDAP servers
* run makefile steps
